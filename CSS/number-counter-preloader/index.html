        <h2><strong>Throwback Challenge 2020 Special Research</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Congratulations to Trainers who completed all four Timed Research lines! You’ve earned access to the Throwback Challenge Champion 2020 Special Research. Join Professor Willow as you rediscover Pokémon originally found in the Unova region and meet Pokémon originally discovered in the Galar region as they make their Pokémon GO debut. Complete all four sets of tasks in this Special Research to earn five Rare Candies; reward encounters with Galarian Meowth, Galarian Stunfisk, and Genesect; and Professor Willow’s glasses as an exclusive avatar item! Unlike the previous sets of Timed Research, this Special Research isn’t time-limited and can be unlocked and completed at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don’t worry if you couldn’t complete all Timed Research lines—you’ll be able to purchase a ticket for the Throwback Challenge Celebration 2020 Special Research in the shop, which will grant you the same tasks and rewards as the Throwback Challenge Champion 2020 Special Research. If you already have access to the Throwback Challenge Champion 2020 Special Research and purchase a ticket for the Throwback Challenge Celebration 2020 Special Research in the shop, you’ll receive a version of the Throwback Challenge Celebration 2020 Special Research with the following changes: each time you would’ve earned a reward encounter with a Pokémon, you instead will earn 10 Candies for that specific Pokémon, and you’ll earn Stardust instead of Professor Willow’s glasses.
        </p>
        <p>
            All Trainers can still enjoy an event taking place during the same time period. In this event, Galarian Stunfisk will be appearing in the wild, and you can hatch Galarian Meowth, Galarian Zigzagoon, Galarian Darumaka, and Galarian Stunfisk from 7 km Eggs. Plus, try evolving Galarian Meowth, Galarian Zigzagoon, and Galarian Darumaka!
