        <p>Trainers,</p>
        <p>
            Do you ever stop and think about how quickly time flies? It feels like it was just yesterday that some of us were faced with the choice between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle right before starting our journey through the Kanto region. Now, over 20 years later, some of us are still exploring the world of Pokémon in the Galar region. Whether your journey with Pokémon began in 1996 with Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue or in 2016 with Pokémon GO, let’s celebrate our collective Pokémon journeys together throughout the month of May!
        </p>
        <p>
            From Friday, May 1, 2020, to Friday, May 29, 2020, you’ll unlock Throwback Challenge Timed Research lines. These Timed Research lines will appear in the Today View and will feature a sequence of limited-time tasks that you’ll have access to until a certain date. Each research line will have eight sets of three tasks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Each week will feature different tasks themed around different regions of the Pokémon world, inspired by the adventures that some might remember from previous Pokémon games. Different Pokémon originally discovered in each region will also be appearing more frequently in the wild to help you complete these tasks. The featured regions will be Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh. If you complete all four of these Timed Research sets, you’ll unlock the Throwback Challenge Champion 2020 Special Research, in which you can earn Rare Candies, reward encounters with Genesect, Galarian Meowth and Galarian Stunfisk, Professor Willow’s glasses as an exclusive avatar item, and more. You’ll be able to complete all these tasks in an individual setting. See the schedule below for when each region will be featured.
